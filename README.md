This work compares the numerical reliability in simulating chaotic systems using C++ and Matlab. The Lower Bound Error was used as a parameter to measure how reliable the simulations are. The chaotic systems of Lorenz and logistic map were used as case studies. With the results one could note that, as expected, C++ is faster than Matlab. However, this paper's main contribution is that, for the same precision (64 bits), C++ shows a more reliable result in terms of the quality of the simulation in such a way that, accordingly to the proposed metric (simulation time), resulted in a gain up to 26% for the Lorenz system and up to 54% for the Logistic map, when compared to Matlab results.
